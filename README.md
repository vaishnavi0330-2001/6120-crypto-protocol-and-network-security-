This project involves a comprehensive study of mobile app security and data privacy, specifically focusing on elderly and disabled individuals. The project aims to evaluate the security vulnerabilities and potential data leakage from mobile applications, which could expose sensitive user information to third-party services or malicious entities.

Key Aspects of the Project:
Objective: Analyze the security protocols of mobile apps commonly used by elderly and disabled users, identifying potential vulnerabilities and risks of data leakage.
Methodology:
Static Analysis: Examining the appâ€™s source code and configuration files to identify security flaws and data handling practices.
Dynamic Analysis: Observing app behavior during real-time usage to uncover possible data exfiltration routes and insecure network communications.
Testing Focus: The study covered a variety of app categories including healthcare, accessibility, communication, and entertainment.
Target Group: 15 elderly and disabled participants who regularly use mobile apps for daily activities, such as medication tracking, telemedicine, and social interaction.
Vulnerabilities Identified: The analysis found several critical vulnerabilities, including insecure data storage, weak encryption practices, and unintentional data sharing with third-party services.
